## What Makes This Project Unique?
1. **Cultural Storytelling**: Unlike other mancala games, this version integrates African storytelling, allowing players to unlock and experience traditional folktales as they progress.
2. **Multilingual Support**: The game supports Hausa and English, making it accessible to a diverse audience.
3. **Customizable Rules**: Proposed amendments to traditional rules enhance the gameplay, making it more strategic and fun.

## Competition Analysis
Most mancala games available today focus on digital replicas of the traditional game with graphical enhancements. However, they often lack:
- Integration of cultural storytelling.
- Support for multiple languages.
- Advanced gameplay mechanics like customizable rules.

**Oware: The Storytelling Game** addresses these gaps, offering a richer and more culturally immersive experience.
